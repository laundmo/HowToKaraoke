6. after that you need to select  "voicemeeter input" as the playback device in TeamSpeak
7. and "voicemeeter **AUX** output" as the capture device in teamspeak.

after that, every sound YOU can hear, EXCEPT what people in teamspeak say, will get mixed together with the your mic and then sent to teamspeak. 
basically peopel will be able to hear everything you hear with your voice

beacause teamspeak uses the voicemeeter input **without** AUX you can select that in any other applications that you dont want to transmit
